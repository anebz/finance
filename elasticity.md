# [Elasticity vs. Inelasticity of Demand](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012915/what-difference-between-inelasticity-and-elasticity-demand.asp)

It means how does the demand respond to a change in another economic factor.  The most common economic factor used when determining elasticity is price.

An elastic product is defined as one where a change in the price of the product leads to a significant change in the demand for that product. Elastic products have substitutes.

Elastic goods: gasoline, inelastic goods: food, prescription drugs, tobacco products, salt. So if there is a 1 percent change in the price of a good, then the amount demanded or supplied will have less than a 1 percent change.
