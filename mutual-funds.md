# [Mudual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp)

It's a financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities. They're operated by professional money managers. They give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios. Each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds trade only once a day after the markets close. 

A mutual fund's share is referred to as the [net asset value (NAV)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp). A fund's NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the total amount of shares outstanding. Outstanding shares are those held by all shareholders, institutional investors, and company officers or insiders.
