# [Credit card vs. debit card](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050214/credit-vs-debit-cards-which-better.asp)

* Debit cards allow bank customers to spend money by drawing on funds they have deposited at the bank, eliminating the danger of racking up debt. Debit cards offer less protection, but they have lower fees.
* Credit cards allow consumers to borrow money from the card issuer up to a certain limit in order to purchase items or withdraw cash. Credit cards offer better consumer protection through warranties and fraud protection but are costlier.
