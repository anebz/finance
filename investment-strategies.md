4 common investing strategies that suit most investors.

## 1. Value investing

[Value investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp) are bargain shoppers, they seek stocks they believe are undervalued. Many value [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) give investors the chance to own a basket of stocks thought to be undervalued. The [Russell 1000 Value Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell_1000index.asp), for example, is a popular benchmark for value investors and several mutual funds mimic this index. In order to make value investing work, you must play the long game.

If you're a true value investor, you'll buy businesses, not stock. [Warren Buffet](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp) does his homework—sometimes for years. But when he’s ready, he goes all in and is committed for the long-term.

If you don't have years to do the research, [price-earnings ratio (P/E)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) is a tool to quickly identify undervalued or cheap stocks. A lower P/E means you're paying less per $1 of current earnings. Value investors seek companies with a low P/E ratio. [More on P/E ratio](p-e-ratio.md)

Value investing can work so long as the investor is in it for the long-term and is prepared to apply some serious effort and research to their stock selection.

## 2. Growth investing

[Growth investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthinvesting.asp) want investments that offer strong upside potential when it comes to the future earnings of stocks. They look for the 'next big thing'. But it's not a reckless embrace of speculative investing, it involves evaluating a stock's current health as well as its potential to grow.

A drawback to growth investing is the lack of [dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). If a company is in growth mode, it needs capital to sustain its expansion, so there's not much left for dividend payments. There are also high variations and a high risk.

Over the long-term, value investing tends to outperform growth investing. But in the short-term, there can be sub-periods where growth investing dominates. The challenge is to find these sub-periods. There's a pattern that growth strategy may be more successful during periods of decreasing GDP.

See article for growth investing variables, risks and examples.

## 3. Momentum investing

[Momentum investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum_investing.asp) believe winners keep winning, and losers keep losing. They look to buy stocks experiencing an uptrend. See more in the article.

## 4. [Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp)

This is the practice of doing regular investments in the market over time, and it isn't mutually exclusive to the other methods described above. The DCA strategy avoids the painful strategy of market timing.

Putting DCA to work means deciding on 3 parameters:

* The total sum to be invested
* The window of time during which the investments will be made
* The frequency of purchases

DCA keeps you commited to saving while reducing the level of risk and the effects of volatility. But if you want to invest a lump sum, DCA might not be the vest option.

According to a 2012 Vanguard study, on average, LSI approach (lump sum investment) outperforms a DCA approach ~66% times, even when results are adjusted for the higher volatility of a stock/bond portfolio vs. cash investments.
