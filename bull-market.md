# [Bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp)

It's the condition of a financial market in which prices are rising or expected to rise. Bull markets tend to last for months or even years.

Bull markets are characterized by optimism, investor confidence and expectations that strong results should continue for an extended period of time.

The most common definition of a bull market is a situation in which stock prices rise by 20%, usually after a drop of 20% and before a second 20% decline. Since bull markets are difficult to predict, analysts can typically only recognize this phenomenon after it has happened.

Bull markets happen when there's a strong GDP, drop in unemployment and a rise in corporate profits.
