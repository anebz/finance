Bonds are units of corporate debt issued by companies and securitized as tradeable assets.

Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall and viceversa.

Bonds have [maturity dates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) at which point the principal amount must be paid in full or risk default.
