# [Bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp)

A bond is a [fixed income instrument](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp) that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond can be thought of as an [I.O.U.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp) between a lender and borrower, including the details of the loan and its payments.

Bonds are units of corporate debt issued by companies and securitized as tradeable assets.

Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall and viceversa.

Bonds have [maturity dates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp) at which point the principal amount must be paid in full or risk default.

## Characteristics

* Face value: money amount the bond will be worth at maturity. you might buy a bond at a premium $1090 and another buy the same bond later at $980. At maturity, both receive $1k
* Coupon rate: rate of interest the bond issuer pays on the face value of the bond, expressed as percentage.

## [Mistakes to avoid when buying bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/07/fixedincome.asp)

1. Ignoring interest rate moves
    * Before a bond's redemption on its maturity date, the price of the issue will vary widely as interest rates fluctuate. Investors shold be prepared to maintain their positions until the actual date of redemption.
2. Not noting the claim status / the type of bond
    * Senior notes are given the first claim to company asset in case of bankruptcy and liquidation
3. Assuming a company is sound
4. Misjudging market perception
    * take a look at the issuer's common stock to see how it is being perceived. If it is disliked, or there is unfavorable research in the public domain on the equity, it will likely spill over and be reflected in the price of the bond as well.
5. Failing to check the history
    * Read the company's [management discussion and analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mdanalysis.asp) (MD&A) section for the company's history
6. Ignoring inflation trends
7. Failing to check liquidity
