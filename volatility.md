# [Volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp)

Volatility represents how large an asset's prices swing around the mean price - it is a statistical measure of its dispersion of returns.

When the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a "volatile" market.

Think of volatility as the annualized standard deviation: Volatility = √ (variance annualized).

(See link to see how to calculate volatility).

## Other measures of volatility

One measure of the relative volatility of a particular stock to the market is its beta (β). A [beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) approximates the overall volatility of a security's returns against the returns of a relevant benchmark (usually the S&P 500 is used). For example, a stock with a beta value of 1.1 has historically moved 110% for every 100% move in the benchmark, based on price level.
