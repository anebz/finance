## Preface

Graham said he hoped every day to do "something foolish, something creative and something generous".

* A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an *ownership interest in an actual business*, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price
* The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable *optimism*  which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified *pessimism* (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.
* The future value of every investment is a function of its present price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.
* No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what Graham called the *margin of safety* —never overpaying, no matter how exciting an investment seems to be—can you minimize your odds of error.
* The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith, and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.

## Chapter 0 Introduction

1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.
2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising industries

## Chapter 1 Investment v speculation

> An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative

Graman's definition of an investment has three elements:

* thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of the underlying businesses, before you buy its stock
* you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses
* you must aspire to adequate, not extraordinary, performance
    - adequate return:  “any rate or amount of return, however low, which the investor is willing to accept, provided he acts with reasonable intelligence.”

Graham urges you to invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price. To reach your long-term financial goals, you must be sustainably and reliably right.

> People who invest make money for themselves, people who speculate make money for their brokers.

In most periods the investor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his common-stock holdings. Speculation risks:

* Speculating when you think you're investing
* Speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it
* Risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose

### Results to be expected by the **defensive** investor

* Have a significant part of the funds in bond-type holdings and a significant part also in equities. 75-25, 50-50.
* Confine yourself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.
* Instead of creating your own common-stock portfolio, use a common trust fund.
* Do 'dollar-cost averaging', invest in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or quarter. Buy more shares when the market is low than when it is high.

### Results to be expected by the **aggressive** investor

Different strategies with high risk for 2 reasons, human fallibility and the competition

1. Trading in the market, short-selling.
2. Short-term selectivity, having stocks of companies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings.
3. Long-term selectivity, there's an excellent record of past growth, likely to continue in the future.

The investor must follow policies which are inherently sound and promising, and not popular on Wall Street.

## Chapter 2 The investor and inflation

The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust their currency has been to buy and hold gold. But between 1935 and 1972, it increased in 35%. But during all this time the holder of gold has received no income return on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual expense for storage.

The investment philosopher Peter L. Bernstein feels that Graham was “dead wrong” about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at least in the years after Graham wrote this chapter) has shown a robust ability to outpace inflation.
 
We feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks in his portfolio, even if we regard them as the lesser of two evils—the greater being the risks in an all-bond holding.

The intelligent investor must always be on guard against whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three good reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:

* In 1979 inflation in the US was at 13.3%, paralyzing the economy in what's become known as 'stagflation'
* Since 1960, 69% of countries have suffered at least one year where inflation was 25% or more. On average, those periods destroyed 53% of an investor's purchasing power
* Completely eradicating inflation runs against the economic self-interest of any government that regularly borrows money

In a time of deflation (or steadily falling prices) it’s more advantageous to be a lender than a borrower—which is why most investors should keep at least a small portion of their assets in bonds, as a form of insurance against deflating prices.

When inflation has been negative (deflation) or above 6%, the market has done terribly. The market likes mild inflation. In the XX. century, there were 64 five-year-periods in which 50 times stocks outpaced inflation. But this means that stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time.

So what to do against inflation?

* REITs: real estate investment trusts, are companies that own and collect rent from commercial and residential properties.
* TIPS: treasury inflation-protected securities, are US government bonds that automatically go up in value when inflation rises. But if the inflation goes up and so does your TIPS value, that income is valued as taxable. Because of this, TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA or 401 (k).

## Chapter 3 a century of stock market history

This chapter has 2 goals: show how stocks have made their underlying advance through the past century, and to view the picture in terms of successive ten-year averages, stock prices and earnings and dividends as well.

The S&D 500 index has 500 stocks, the Dow Jones / DJIA has 30 companies, one is ATT and the others large industrial enterprises.

General advice when stocks are very high, like in 1964:

1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities
2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks
3. A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring it down to a maximum of 50% of the total portfolio. The capital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible, and the proceeds invested in first-quality bonds or held as a savings deposit

Investors who for some time have been following a bona fide dollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their periodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel the market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather strongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the late 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina to pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should appear highly unfavorable.

The heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must
never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the mistake that one pundit after another made in
the 1990s.

When Graham asked, “Can such heedlessness go unpunished?” he knew that the eternal answer to that question is no. Like an enraged Greek god, the stock market crushed everyone who had come to believe that the high returns of the late 1990s were some kind of divine right.

In the real world, then, stocks did no better than cash and bonds—and perhaps a bit worse. Anyone who claims that the long-term record “proves” that stocks are guaranteed to outperform bonds or cash is an ignoramus.

Graham’s answers, as always, are rooted in logic and common sense. The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function of the price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was withering away, corporate profits appeared to be booming, and most of the world was at peace. But that did not mean—nor could it ever mean— that stocks were worth buying at any price. Since the profits that companies can earn are finite, the price that investors should be willing to pay for stocks must also be finite.

Even though investors all know they’re supposed to buy low and sell high, in practice they often end up getting it backwards. Graham’s warning in this chapter is simple: “By the rule of opposites,” the more enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run, the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run.

The stock market's performance depends on three factors:

* real growth, the rise of companies' earnings and dividends
    - 1-5-2% in the long run
* inflationary growth, the general rise of prices throughout the economy
    - 2.4% in the US as of 2003
* speculative growth/decile, any increase/decrease in the investing public's appetite for stocks
    - 1.9% of dividend yield

In the long run, you can reasonably expect stocks to average roughly a 6% return, or 4% after inflation.

But there is a second lesson in Graham’s approach. The only thing you can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that you will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that the past teaches us is that the future will always surprise us—always!

## Chapter 4 general portfolio policy
 
There has developed the general notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run. Our view is different. The rate of return sought should be dependent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes to our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from concern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and enterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and skill.

### The bond component

Taxable or tax-fre bonds, and shorter- or longer-term maturities? The tax decision should be mainly a matter of arithmetic, turning on the difference in yields as compared with the investor's tax bracket.

The choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a different question, viz.: Does the investor want to assure himself against a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a lower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable gain in principal value? See chapter 8.

There are two ways to be an intelligent investor:

* active/enterprising: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds;
* passive/defensive: or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement)

Instead of deciding your risk degree depending on your age, think about the fundamental circumstances of oyur life, when they will kick in, when they might change, and how they are likely to affect your need for cash. Once you set your risk factor, change the percentages only as your life circumstances change, not because of the stock market changes.

## Chapter 5 the defensive investor and common stocks

4 rules for the defensive investor regarding the stocks portfolio

1. Adequate though not excessive diversification. 10-30 issues
2. Each company selected should be large, prominent and conservatively financed
3. Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments
4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he'll pay for an issue in relation to its average earning. Suggestion, the limit should be at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last year.

Growth stock has increased its per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future. but this is too risky for the defensive investor.

It is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good preferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good common stocks. From this was derived the popular prejudice against common stocks because they are not “safe”. A properly executed group investment in common stocks does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that therefore it should not be termed “risky” merely because of the element of price fluctuation.

Peter Lynch piloted Fidelity Magellan from 1977 through 1990 to the best track record ever compiled by a mutual fund. He insists that no one should ever invest in a company, no matter how great its products or how crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements and estimating its business value. **Unfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.** 

But familiarity breeds complacency, just because you know something doesn't mean you know the financial intricancies of it. The more familiar a stock is, the more likely it is to turn a defensive investor into a lazy one who thinks there’s no need to do any homework.

## Chapter 6 portfolio policy for the enterprising investor 133-145-155 147-159-169

Experience clearly shows that it is unwise to buy a bond or a preferred which lacks adequate safety merely because the yield is attractive.

It is bad business to accept an acknowledged possibility of a loss of principal in exchange for a mere 1 or 2% of additional yearly income. If you are willing to assume some risk you should be certain that you can realize a really substantial gain in principal value if things go well.

An elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an ability to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new commonstock issues during bull markets.
