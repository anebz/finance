## Preface

Graham said he hoped every day to do "something foolish, something creative and something generous".

* A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an *ownership interest in an actual business*, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price
* The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable *optimism*  which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified *pessimism* (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.
* The future value of every investment is a function of its present price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.
* No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what Graham called the *margin of safety* —never overpaying, no matter how exciting an investment seems to be—can you minimize your odds of error.
* The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith, and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.

## Chapter 0 Introduction

1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.
2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising industries

## Chapter 1 Investment v speculation

> An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative

Graman's definition of an investment has three elements:

* thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of the underlying businesses, before you buy its stock
* you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses
* you must aspire to adequate, not extraordinary, performance
    - adequate return:  “any rate or amount of return, however low, which the investor is willing to accept, provided he acts with reasonable intelligence.”

Graham urges you to invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price. To reach your long-term financial goals, you must be sustainably and reliably right.

> People who invest make money for themselves, people who speculate make money for their brokers.

In most periods the investor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his common-stock holdings. Speculation risks:

* Speculating when you think you're investing
* Speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it
* Risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose

### Results to be expected by the **defensive** investor

* Have a significant part of the funds in bond-type holdings and a significant part also in equities. 75-25, 50-50.
* Confine yourself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.
* Instead of creating your own common-stock portfolio, use a common trust fund.
* Do 'dollar-cost averaging', invest in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or quarter. Buy more shares when the market is low than when it is high.

### Results to be expected by the **aggressive** investor

Different strategies with high risk for 2 reasons, human fallibility and the competition

1. Trading in the market, short-selling.
2. Short-term selectivity, having stocks of companies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings.
3. Long-term selectivity, there's an excellent record of past growth, likely to continue in the future.

The investor must follow policies which are inherently sound and promising, and not popular on Wall Street.
