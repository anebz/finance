# [Herd instinct](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/herdinstinct.asp)

Herd instinct in finance is the phenomenon where investors follow what they perceive other investors are doing, rather than their own analysis. An investor exhibiting herd instinct will gravitate toward the same or similar investments based almost solely on the fact that many others are buying the securities.

The [dotcom bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp) of the late 1990s and early 2000s is a prime example of the ramifications of herd instinct in the growth and subsequent bursting of that industry's bubble.

[Behavioral finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp) theory attributes this conduct to the natural human tendency to be influenced by societal influences that trigger the fear of being alone or the fear of missing out.

An investment [bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) occurs when exuberant market behavior drives a rapid escalation in the price of an asset above and beyond its intrinsic value. The bubble continues to inflate until the asset price reaches a level beyond fundamental and economical rationality. At this stage in a bubbleâ€™s existence, further increases in the cost of the asset often are contingent purely on investors continuing to buy in at the highest price. When investors are no longer willing to buy at that price level, the bubble begins to collapse. In speculative markets, the burst can incite far-reaching corollary effects.
