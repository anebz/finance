* Do your homework and find the minimum deposit requirements
* Compare commissions of different brokers
* You won't be able to cost-effectively buy individual stocks and still be diversified

## 1. Starting strategies

### 1.1. Automate savings

* Set aside some money to save regularly
* Use savings app if they help you: Acorns, Qapital, Chime
  * Acorns puts money into one of several low-cost ETF portfolios, this is a good option for small savers.
  * Chime is an online bank as well as an app, offers a savings account that automatically sets aside 10% of every paycheck
  * **Check if your bank allows you to automatically transfer funds from non-saving accounts to those better suited for savings and investment**.
* Pay off high-interest debts first
* Take advantage of retirement plans
* Think about the level of risk you're comfortable with
* Trade up to better choices as your investment pot grows

### 1.2. Deal with your debts

If you’re carrying a lot of high-interest debt, pay off at least some of it before you make investments.

### 1.3. Consider your retirement

Take full advantage of the inducements dangled by governments and employers to encourage retirement security. If your company offers a 401(k) retirement plan, don’t overlook it. That’s doubly the case if your company matches part or all of your contribution to the plan

401(k)s and some other retirement vehicles are also powerful investments because of their favorable tax treatment.

\#TODO question: what if you change companies? What happens with the 401 (k)? Probably goes back to the individual, and compounds over the professional career independently from the company.

### 1.4. Invest your tax refund

If you find it hard to save money throughout the year, consider setting aside part or all of your tax refund.

## 2. Recommendation by investment amount

**No matter what kind of product you are investing in, it’s vital that you understand (and do your best to minimize) the fees associated with it.**.

You’ll also need to weigh likely returns on your investments against the level of risk you’re comfortable with taking.

### 2.1. How to invest $500

If you want to play it safe, park your sum in a certificate of deposit (CD) from a bank or other lender or use it to buy short-term [Treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/introduction-treasury-securities.asp), which you can [purchase through an online broker](https://www.investopedia.com/best-brokers-for-beginners-4587873). The growth potential of both options is limited, but the risks are virtually zero. It's a way to earn a little on your money until your nest egg grows to the point where other options are available.

If you're comfortable with more risk, one option is investing in [dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendreinvestmentplan.asp). You buy shares of stock, and your dividends are automatically used to purchase additional shares or even fractional shares. These shares are purchased at a discount and without paying a sales commission to a broker. Buying a single share of a company's stock can get you started.

Another option is an **exchange-traded fund (ETF)**, most of which require no minimum investment. Unlike most mutual funds, ETFs typically require a [passive management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passivemanagement.asp) structure, which means lower ongoing costs. There are [some drawbacks to ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/07/etf_downside.asp), for example you have to pay fees on their transactions. To lessen these charges, you can use a discount broker that doesn't charge a commission or plan to invest less often, investing more money quarterly rather than small monthly purchases.

If you're comfortable with a lot of risk, you can invest in [peer-to-peer lending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-to-peer-lending.asp). [Crowdfunders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crowdfunding.asp) connect investors with money to lend and entrepreneurs trying to fund new ventures. As the loans are repaid, the investors receive a share of the interest in proportion to the amount they have invested. Lending Club requires $1k minimum to start, Prosper $25. Crowdfunding offers high risk, but also the prospect of higher earnings.

### 2.2. How to invest $1k

[Target-date funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/target-date_fund.asp) usually have a $1k minimum investment. You can choose the target date, the investments in the fund are automatically adjusted over time, with the overall mix moving from riskier to safer as your target date becomes closer.

This is useful if you're saving for retirement or a home purchase. In the beginning, you have time and can make riskier investments. But as the target date is closer, you want to protect yourself against sudden losses.

You can also purchase individual stock shares, which have higher risk but can generate higher returns. Investing in individual stocks that pay dividends is a smart strategy. You have the option of receiving the dividends as cash payouts or reinvesting them in additional shares.

### 2.3. How to invest $3k

You can access more mutual funds, but they require higher minimum investments. Vanguard requires $3k for most of its funds.

First consider an [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp), a type of mutual fund that tracks a specific market index, such as Standard & Poor 500, or the Down Jones Industrials, and offers relatively low fees. Like ETFs, index funds are passively managed -> lower [expense ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp), which in turn have moderate fees.

The goal of an index fund is to at least match the performance of the index, it also gives you broad exposure to a number of asset classes.

### 2.4. How to invest $5k

You can invest in real estate, for example [a real estate investment trust (REIT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp). This is a corporation that owns a group of properties or mortgages that produce a continuous stream of income. As a REIT investor you're entitled to a share of the income generated by the underlying properties. REITs are required by law to pay out 90% of their income to investors as dividends annually. REITs can be traded or nontraded, with the latter carrying much higher upfront fees.

\#TODO question: is this only in USA? Probably, most advice is USA centric.

Another option is real estate crowdfunding, usually the minimum investment to gain entry to private real estate deals is $5k.

Another option is [debt and equity investments](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122315/equity-vs-debt-investments-real-estate-crowdfunding.asp) in commercial and residential properties. Returns for debt investments range from 8-12% a year. Equity investments can see higher yields if the value of the property increases. These investments carry more [risks than more traditional investments](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/070915/pros-cons-investing-crowdfunded-property.asp).
