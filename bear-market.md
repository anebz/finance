# [Bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp)

It's when a market experiences prolonged price declines. Typically, securities prices fall 20%. Bear markets also may accompany general economic downturns such as a recession.

Bear markets can be cyclical or longer-term. The former lasts for several weeks or a couple of months and the latter can last for several years or even decades.

The causes of a bear market often vary, but in general, a weak or slowing or sluggish economy will bring with it a bear market

Short selling, put options, and inverse ETFs are some of the ways in which investors can make money during a bear market as prices fall. The signs of a weak or slowing economy are typically low employment, low disposable income, weak productivity and a drop in business profits.

## Phases of a bear market

1. Hhigh prices and high investor sentiment
2. [Capitulation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitulation.asp): stock prices begin to fall sharply, economic indicators which were positive previously, start to become average
3. Speculators try to enter the market, raising some prices and trading volume
4. Stock prices continue to drop, but slowly. As low prices and good news starts to attract investors again, bear markets start to lead to bull markets.

Between 1900 and 2018, there were 33 bear markets, averaging one every 3.5 years. One of the most recent bear markets coincided with the global financial crisis occurring between October 2007 and March 2009. During that time the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined 54%.

## How to earn money in a bear market

[Inverse ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverse-etf.asp) are designed to change values in the opposite direction of the index they track. For example, the inverse ETF for the S&P 500 would increase by 1% if the S&P 500 index decreased by 1%.

## [Bear trap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beartrap.asp)

It's a false technical indication of a reversal from a down- to an up-market that can lure unsuspecting investors.

Bear traps can tempt investors into taking long positions based on anticipation of price movements which do not end up taking place.

A bullish trader may sell a declining asset in order to retain profits while a bearish trader may attempt to short that asset, with the intention of buying it back after the price has dropped to a certain level. If that downward trend never occurs or reverses after a brief period, the price reversal is identified as a bear trap.

A bear is an investor or trader in the financial markets who believes that the price of a security is about to decline.
