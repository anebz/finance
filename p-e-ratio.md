# [P/E ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp)

The P/E ratio is the ratio for valuing a company that **measures its current share price relative to its peer-share earnings** ([EPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp)).

The price-to-earning ratio is known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple.

P/E ratios are used by analysts and investors to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compute a company against its own historical record, or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time.

High P/E ratio: a company's stock is overvalued, or investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.

If a company has no earning or is losing money, it has no P/E ratio.

A P/E ratio is calculated when **analysts determine if the share price accurately represents the projected earnings per share**.

> P/E ratio = market value per share / earnings per share

To [determine the P/E value](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070314/how-do-i-calculate-pe-ratio-company.asp), one must divide the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS).

The current stock price (P) can be gleaned by plugging a stock's ticker symbol into any finance website.

EPS comes in 2 varieties.

1. A metric listed in the fundamentals section of most finance sytes, with the notation of "P/E TTM"
2. The second type of EPS is found in a company's earnings release, which often provide EPS guidance.

## Types of P/E ratios

### 1. [Forward P/E](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardpe.asp)

This uses [future earning guidance](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/012903.asp). It's useful for comparing current earnings to future earnings.

Companies can however underestimate earnings in order to beat the estimate P/E when the next quarter's earnings are announced.

### 2. [Trailing P/E](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingpe.asp)

The trailing P/E relies on past performance by dividing the [current share price](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp) by the total EPS earnings over the past year. It's the most popular P/E metric because it's the most objective.

But a company's past performance doesn't signal future behavior. Investors should thus commit money based on future [earning power](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-power.asp), not the past. The EPS number remains constant, while the stock prices fluctuate, which is also a problem.

If the forward P/E is lower than the trailing P/E, it means analysts are expecting earnings to increase. else, analysts expect a decrease in earnings.
