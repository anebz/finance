### [Robo-advisors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp)

Their goal is to use technology to lower costs for investors and streamline investment advice. An algorithm makes investment decisions for you, including tax-loss harvesting and rebalancing.

And as the success of [index investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) has shown, if your goal is long-term wealth building, you might do better with a robo-advisor.

### Investing through your employer

If you're on a tight budget, try to invest 1% of your salary into your company's retirement plan. If you have a 401(k) retirement account at work, you may already be investing in your future with allocations to mutual funds and even your own company's stock.

### Minimums to open an account

Many firms or financial institutions don't allow you to open an account below a minimum threshold. Some don't require minimum deposits, others offer lower costs, like [trading](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/difference-investing-trading.asp) fees and account management fees if you have a balance above a threshold.

It's important to do some research before deciding where you want to open your account.

### Commissions and fees

All brokers have to make money from their customers one way or another, so if someone offers very low commissions, they'll get the money from somewhere else.

In most cases, brokers charge a commission every time you trade stock, either through buying or selling. It can be $2-$10/stock. If your budget is small, it might not be benefitial to you to buy/sell stock very often.

### Diversify and reduce risks

By investing in a range of assets, you reduce the risk of one investment's performance severely hurting the return of your overall investment: 'don't put all your eggs in one basket'.

With a small budget ($1k) it's nearly impossible to have a well-diversified portfolio, so you can only invest in 1-2 companies (at the most) in the beginning. *This will increase your risk*.

If you're investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETF s), they have a large number of stocks and other investments within the fund, which makes them more diversified than a single stock.

## Investing with a [small budget](small-budget.md) (see file)

* Do your homework and find the minimum deposit requirements
* Compare commissions of different brokers
* You won't be able to cost-effectively buy individual stocks and still be diversified
