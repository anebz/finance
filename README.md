### [Robo-advisors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp)

Their goal is to use technology to lower costs for investors and streamline investment advice. An algorithm makes investment decisions for you, including tax-loss harvesting and rebalancing.

And as the success of [index investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) has shown, if your goal is long-term wealth building, you might do better with a robo-advisor.

### Investing through your employer

If you're on a tight budget, try to invest 1% of your salary into your company's retirement plan. If you have a 401(k) retirement account at work, you may already be investing in your future with allocations to mutual funds and even your own company's stock.

### Minimums to open an account

Many firms or financial institutions don't allow you to open an account below a minimum threshold. Some don't require minimum deposits, others offer lower costs, like [trading](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/difference-investing-trading.asp) fees and account management fees if you have a balance above a threshold.

It's important to do some research before deciding where you want to open your account.

### Commissions and fees

All brokers have to make money from their customers one way or another, so if someone offers very low commissions, they'll get the money from somewhere else.

In most cases, brokers charge a commission every time you trade stock, either through buying or selling. It can be $2-$10/stock. If your budget is small, it might not be benefitial to you to buy/sell stock very often.

### Diversify and reduce risks

By investing in a range of assets, you reduce the risk of one investment's performance severely hurting the return of your overall investment: 'don't put all your eggs in one basket'.

With a small budget ($1k) it's nearly impossible to have a well-diversified portfolio, so you can only invest in 1-2 companies (at the most) in the beginning. *This will increase your risk*.

If you're investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETF s), they have a large number of stocks and other investments within the fund, which makes them more diversified than a single stock.

## Investing with a [small budget](small-budget.md) (see file)

* Do your homework and find the minimum deposit requirements
* Compare commissions of different brokers
* You won't be able to cost-effectively buy individual stocks and still be diversified

## [Benjamin Graham's timeless investment principles](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/grahamprinciples.asp)

Graham is considered the father of security analysis and [value investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp).

His two famous books are "Security Analysis" (1934) and "The intelligent investor" (1949). 

### 1. Always invest with a [margin of safety](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginofsafety.asp)

Margin of safety is the principle of buying a security at a significant discount to its [intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp), which is thought to not only provide high-return opportunities, but also to minimize the downside risk of an investment. Graham's goal was to buy assets worth $1 for 50 cents.

There's a safety net when buying an underlying business for much less than it is worth. Value investing can provide substantial profits once the market inevitably re-evaluates the stock and ups its price to [fair value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairvalue.asp).

### 2. Expect [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) and profit from it

Instead of running for the exists during times of market stress, the smart investor greets downturns as chances to find great investments. Graham illustrates this with the analogy of ["Mr. Market"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mr-market.asp), the imaginary business partner of every investor.

The idea is that you shouldn't let Mr Market's views dictate your own emotions, or lead you in your investment decisions. The market will fluctuate, sometimes wildly, but rather than fearing volatility, use it to your advantage to get bargains in the market.

Graham suggested 2 strategies to help mitigate the negative effects of market volatility:

#### 2.1. [Dollar-cost averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp)

This is achieved when buying equal dollar amounts of investments at regular intervals, this is ideal for passive investors and alleviates them of the responsibility of choosing when and at what price to buy their positions.

#### 2.2. Investing in stocks and bonds

Graham recommended distributing one's portfolio **evenly** between stocks and bonds. Graham's philosophy was first to preserve capital, and then try to make it grow.

### 3. Know what kind of investor you are

You can either be an [active](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activeinvesting.asp), enterprising investor or a [passive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp), a defensive investor.

If you're willing to spend a lot of time researching, Graham thought work=return. The more work you put into your investment, the higher your return should be.

If not, then investing in an [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) is a good alternative. Graham said that the defensive investor could get an [average return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagereturn.asp) by simply buying the 30 stocks of the [Dow Jones industrial average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp) in equal amounts. Both Graham and Buffett said that getting even an average return, such as the return of the [S&P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), is more of an accomplishment than it might seem.

In modern terms, the defensive investor would be [an investor in index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/101415/4-best-sp-500-index-funds.asp) of both stocks and bonds. In essence, they own the entire market, benefiting from the areas that perform the best without trying to predict those areas ahead of time
