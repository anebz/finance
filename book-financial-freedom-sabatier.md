## Capter 2. Time is more valuable than money

The key to fast-tracking financial freedom is to speed up compounding by making and investing as much money as early and frequently as you can.

The earnings (or losses) of the stock market can vary wildly from month to month and from year to year, but over the long term, many economists have found that the real dollar returns (meaning returns adjusted to account for inflation and stock dividends) of the U.S. stock market average between 7 and 9 percent per year.

Advisable to put the money in a total stock market index fund, which tracks the performance of the entire stock market and is therefore most likely to generate the average 7 percent return over time.

Money is inherently infinite, it's a human invention. But time is inherently limited.
