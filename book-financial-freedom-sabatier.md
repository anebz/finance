## Chapter 2. Time is more valuable than money

The key to fast-tracking financial freedom is to speed up compounding by making and investing as much money as early and frequently as you can.

The earnings (or losses) of the stock market can vary wildly from month to month and from year to year, but over the long term, many economists have found that the real dollar returns (meaning returns adjusted to account for inflation and stock dividends) of the U.S. stock market average between 7 and 9 percent per year.

Advisable to put the money in a total stock market index fund, which tracks the performance of the entire stock market and is therefore most likely to generate the average 7 percent return over time.

Money is inherently infinite, it's a human invention. But time is inherently limited.

## Chapter 3. What is your number?

Two key concepts:

* asset allocation: the percentage of stocks vs. bonds, which determines the level of risk/reward in your portfolio
* withdrawal rate: the amount of money one withdraws from an investment portfolio each month to live on.

**Investing is a long-term game, it takes years for compounding to pay off.** How much money you need ultimately depends on the type of lyfestyle you want to live.

The earlier you start, the less money you need to have saved before you can retire, given that you have a much longer compounding period for your investments.

To maximize the odds of your money lasting for the rest of your life, you need to adhere to a set of specific guidelines:

* save at least 25 times your expected annual expenses
* defer taking your investment gains as long as possible by using side or passive income
* have one year of expenses in cash on hand
* live on as little of your investing gains as possible
* preserve as much of your investment principal, the money you originally contributed to, for as long as possible.

Break down your number down into smaller, more attainable daily, weekly, monthly, and annual savings goals.

## Chapter 4. Where are you now?

(check the paragraph for information on debt, and on how to calculate your net worth)

Financial advisors exist not because managing money is all that complicated, but because they know how to stop their clients from making dumb decisions when the market goes down.

Very loss averse people just keep their money in the bank, in a savings account making 1% or less, effectively losing money because inflation rises to 2-3% each year. (might be in the US, but in Spain it's currently 1.1%, and ~2% in Germany).

But humans generally fear losing more than we enjoy winning, a concept known as *loss aversion*.

## Chapter 5. Next-level money

All the ways to build wealth rely on the same three basic variables:

1. Income: how much money you are making
2. Savings: how much money you are saving/investing
3. Expenses: how much money you are spending
