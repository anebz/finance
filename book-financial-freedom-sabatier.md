## Chapter 2. Time is more valuable than money

The key to fast-tracking financial freedom is to speed up compounding by making and investing as much money as early and frequently as you can.

The earnings (or losses) of the stock market can vary wildly from month to month and from year to year, but over the long term, many economists have found that the real dollar returns (meaning returns adjusted to account for inflation and stock dividends) of the U.S. stock market average between 7 and 9 percent per year.

Advisable to put the money in a total stock market index fund, which tracks the performance of the entire stock market and is therefore most likely to generate the average 7 percent return over time.

Money is inherently infinite, it's a human invention. But time is inherently limited.

## Chapter 3. What is your number?

Two key concepts:

* asset allocation: the percentage of stocks vs. bonds, which determines the level of risk/reward in your portfolio
* withdrawal rate: the amount of money one withdraws from an investment portfolio each month to live on.

**Investing is a long-term game, it takes years for compounding to pay off.** How much money you need ultimately depends on the type of lyfestyle you want to live.

The earlier you start, the less money you need to have saved before you can retire, given that you have a much longer compounding period for your investments.

To maximize the odds of your money lasting for the rest of your life, you need to adhere to a set of specific guidelines:

* save at least 25 times your expected annual expenses
* defer taking your investment gains as long as possible by using side or passive income
* have one year of expenses in cash on hand
* live on as little of your investing gains as possible
* preserve as much of your investment principal, the money you originally contributed to, for as long as possible.

Break down your number down into smaller, more attainable daily, weekly, monthly, and annual savings goals.

## Chapter 4. Where are you now?

(check the paragraph for information on debt, and on how to calculate your net worth)

Financial advisors exist not because managing money is all that complicated, but because they know how to stop their clients from making dumb decisions when the market goes down.

Very loss averse people just keep their money in the bank, in a savings account making 1% or less, effectively losing money because inflation rises to 2-3% each year. (might be in the US, but in Spain it's currently 1.1%, and ~2% in Germany).

But humans generally fear losing more than we enjoy winning, a concept known as *loss aversion*.

## Chapter 5. Next-level money

All the ways to build wealth rely on the same three basic variables:

1. Income: how much money you are making
2. Savings: how much money you are saving/investing
3. Expenses: how much money you are spending

Savings rate: you can calculate it in currency or percentage, it's the amount of money you save divided by your income. This number is directly correlated with the amount of time it'll take you to hit your number.

To make as much money as possible, consider cutting expenses, optimizing fees/prices, minimizing taxes, building multiple income streams like side hustling, entrepreneurship.

## Chapter 6. Is it worth it?

How to cut expenses, ask yourself these 11 questions before buying anything:

1. How happy will this purchase make me?
2. How much money do I have to make to afford this?
3. How many hours of my life am I trading to afford this?
4. Can I afford it?
5. How do prices compare in terms of percentages?
6. Can I get it for less or trade for it?
7. How much am I spending on convenience?
8. How much would this cost me each year or for the rest of my life?
9. What is the per-use cost of this item?
10. How much will this money be worth in the future?
11. How much time/freedom is this buying me in the future?

## Chapter 7. The only budget you'll need

You can likely save at least 20% per month by cutting back on your 3 biggest expenses: housing, transportation and food.

## Chapter 8. Hack your 9-to-5

Maximize your benefits and salary at your job, consider asking for a raise, **skills + network = money**.

## Chapter 9. More money in less time

Diversify your income streams by developing **side hustles**, moneymaking ventures outside your full-time job. Investing the money earnt by side hustling will fast track your investment growth.

Find a side hustle:

* where you can work for yourself
* that pays well for your time
* that you enjoy so you'll stick with it
* that teaches you new skills
* that has growth potential
* that has passive income potential

Evaluate how much time you're realistically willing to commit to it, because this will determine the types of side hustles you can launch and how much money you can make.

The most lucrative side hustles are ones that generate passive income, money you can earn without actively having to do anything.

The side hustle evaluation framework:

* Analyze your passions and skills
* Can you get paid for any of them, can you launch a course teaching people how to do something, can you sell it locally in your community?
* Evaluate the moneymaking potential of your side hustles
* Think about how much to charge, get your first sale, and get paid as much as possible. Things that determine how much you can charge:
    - skills required to perform the task, or your relative skill level as compared to your competitors
    - demand
    - how much your competitors are charging
    - added value, any additional services or bonuses you offer
    - perceived value, based on your reputation or how valuable your offering is to the customer
    - how much someone is able to pay
