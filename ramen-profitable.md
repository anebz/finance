# [Ramen profitable](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html)

It means that a startup makes just enough to pay the founder's living expenses.

In the past, startups raised and spent a lot of money. A company making computer hardware might not be profitable for 5 years, during which they spent $50M. But when they did, they might have revenues of $50M/year.

Ramen profitability is the other extreme, a startup that becomes profitable after 2 months, even though its revenues are only $3000 a month, because the only employees are a couple 25 year old founders who can live on practically nothing. they don't need to raise money to survive.

This is a new concept and only applicable to some sectors like software startups, because software is now so cheap.

If you don't need the money, you can get better terms at getting investors.

What keeps young people from creating their own startup? It's not the money, or the hours, it's usually fear of having so much responsibility.

Raising money is a long long journey and very distracting, the startup's productivity comes to a halt. Why? Because you think about i all the time.

The biggest danger in ramen profitability is that it might turn you into a consulting firm. Startups have to be product companies, in the sense of making a single thing that everyone uses.

It's ok to do a little consulting-type work at first. Startups usually have to do something weird at first. But remember that ramen profitability is not the destination. A startup's destination is to grow really big; ramen profitability is a trick for not dying en route.
