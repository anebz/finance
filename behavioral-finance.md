# [Behavioral finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp)

Behavioral finance is a field of study that argues that, when making investment decisions, people are not nearly as rational as [traditional finance theory](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/041213/modern-portfolio-theory-vs-behavioral-finance.asp) makes out.

Here is one experiment: Offer someone a choice of a sure $50 or, on the flip of a coin, the possibility of winning $100 or winning nothing. Chances are the person will pocket the sure thing. Conversely, offer a choice of 1) a sure loss of $50 or 2) on a flip of a coin, either a loss of $100 or nothing. The person, rather than accept a $50 loss, will probably pick the second option and flip the coin.

People view the possibility of recouping a loss as more important than the possibility of greater gain. The priority of avoiding losses also holds true for investors.

### Behavioral finance concepts

* [Mental accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mentalaccounting.asp): it's the propensity for people to allocate money for specific purposes
* [Herd behavior](herd-instinct.md): people tend to mimic the financial behaviors of the majority of the herd.
* Emotional gap: it's the decision making based on extreme emotions or emotional strains.
* [Anchoring](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp): attaching a spending level to a certain reference. Example: spending consistently based on a budget level or rationalizing spending based on different satisfaction utilities
* Self-attribution: a tendency to make choices based on a confidence in self-based knowledge. It stems from intrinsic confidence of a particular area.

### Biases studied in behavioral finance

* Disposition bias
    - Investors tend to admit their correct about an investment quickly (when there's a gain).
    - However, investors are reluctant to admit when they made an investment mistake (when there's a loss). 
    - Investors gauge the performance of their investment based on their individual entry price disregarding fundamentals or attributes of the investment that may have changed
* Confirmation bias
* Experiential bias
    - when investors' memory of recent events makes them biased or leads them to believe that the event is far more likely to occur again
* Loss aversion
    - when the losses weight more than the gains
* Familiarity bias
    - when investors invest in what they know, domestic or locally owned companies. This leads to a lack of diversification
