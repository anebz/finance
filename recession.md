# [Recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp)

A recession is a [macroeconomic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp) term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a designated region. It's a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.

Since the [Industrial Revolution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp), the long-term macroeconomic trend in most countries has been economic growth.

Recession is a normal, albeit unpleasant, part of the [business cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp).

## Interest rates during a recesion

During a recesion, interest rates fall. The [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) has tools to control interest rates, like coaxing rates downward to stimulate the economy.

The Fed knows how to use the fact that people save in a recession, and lower rates to a point where people think it might be stupid to not take advantage of such attractive rates. This is turn leads to an influx in loans, which pumps money back into the system and theoretically jumpstarts an economy.

A downside of this quantitative easing, or QE, is when countries keep interest rates too low—or even negative—for too long and the economy goes into stagnation.

## [Things not to do during a recession](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/avoid-five-recession-risks.asp)

* Avoid becoming a cosigner, cosigning a loan
* Avoid taking out an adjustable-rate mortgage
    - the adjustable rate for a loan taken out during a recession is nearly certain to rise
* Avoid taking on new debt
* Don't take your job for granted
* Don't take risks with investments

## [Deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp)

Deflation is when the general price levels in a country are falling—as opposed to inflation when prices rise. It can be caused by an increase in productivity, a decrease in overall demand, or a decrease in the volume of credit in the economy.

Deflation can be brought about either by an increase in the supply of goods and services or by a lack of increase (or decrease) in the supply of money and credit. In either case, if prices can adjust downward, then this results in a generally falling price level. An increase in the supply of goods and services in an economy typically results from technological progress, the discovery of new resources, or an increase in productivity.

A little bit of deflation is a product of, and good for, economic growth. But, in the case of an economy-wide, central bank fueled debt bubble followed by debt deflation when the bubble bursts, rapidly falling prices can go hand-in-hand with financial crisis and recession. Thankfully, the period of debt deflation and recession that follows is temporary, and can be avoided entirely if the perennial temptation to inflate the supply of money and credit in the first place can be resisted. 

All in all, it is not deflation, but the inflationary period that then leads to debt deflation that is dangerous for a country's economy.

## [Industries That Thrive During Recessions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/industries-thrive-on-recession.asp)

these are often industries where demand is inelastic to changes in prices and incomes - the volume of consumer demand is relatively stable. For example discount retailers, health care, because it's inelastic. Utilities, personal storage.  Food and restauranta, DIY and repairs, freight and logistics, goods need to be moved, recession or not.

Healthcare, food, consumer staples, and basic transportation are examples of relatively inelastic industries that can perform well in recessions.
