# [Recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp)

A recession is a [macroeconomic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp) term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a designated region. It's a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.

Since the [Industrial Revolution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp), the long-term macroeconomic trend in most countries has been economic growth.

Recession is a normal, albeit unpleasant, part of the [business cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp).

### Interest rates during a recesion

During a recesion, interest rates fall. The [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) has tools to control interest rates, like coaxing rates downward to stimulate the economy.

The Fed knows how to use the fact that people save in a recession, and lower rates to a point where people think it might be stupid to not take advantage of such attractive rates. This is turn leads to an influx in loans, which pumps money back into the system and theoretically jumpstarts an economy.

A downside of this quantitative easing, or QE, is when countries keep interest rates too low—or even negative—for too long and the economy goes into stagnation.
